Bugs in rl_decode() function:
-----------------------------


Bug #1:
When we are summing up the counts, we were using %bl (byte 8) of the %rbx
register. However, because %bl is only one byte, this can certainly overflow.
Thus, to allow for the addition of all the counts without overflow, we change
%bl to %ebx, so now there are 4 bytes to hold the total sum.

Bug #2:
In find_space_loop, Ben chose to add 1 to the loop variable to forward
to the next count. However, he must have forgotten that our input data
comes in the form of [count][value] pairs. Because find_space_loop is only
supposed to loop over all the counts and only the counts, we need to add
2 to the loop variable instead of 1. Previously, when Ben was only adding 1
he was adding counts to values, which is not what we want to do in 
determining the amount of space required to decode the data. 

Bug #3:
In find_space_done, we call malloc, but Ben forgot to save the caller-save 
registers onto the stack. Because %rsi and %rdx are caller-save, they need
to be pushed onto the stack before the call to malloc and then popped off the
stack when malloc is finished. Otherwise, malloc could mess with these
registers under the assumption that their previous values have been saved,
so if they are not, then when the rest of rl_decode uses the values of 
%rsi and %rdx, they will not get the values that are expecting. 

Bug #4:
In write_loop, %r10, representing the index in the output buffer is 
never incremented. Thus, we are always writing to the same memory spot (%rax).
To fix this, I simply added a line to increment %r10 before the line to
decrement %bh which is important because the jnz should depend on the flags
set from decrementing %bh (the number of repetitions) as opposed to the 
incrementing %r10 (in which case, we would always jump and end up with
an infinite loop).
