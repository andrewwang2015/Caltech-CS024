This yield an infinite loop. Upon further examination of the code's logic,
it is not too difficult to see why. In this case, divisor is 0 and dividend
is 10. This function starts by setting remainder = dividend = 10. Now, notice
that in our while loop, we only break if remainder becomes negative
(remainder < 0). Because the only statement to update the value of remainder
is remainder = remainder - divisor, in the case where divisor is 0, 
remainder remains unchanged. Thus, if we start with remainder = dividend = 10,
remainder will always be 10, and thus we will never break out of the while
loop. This ultimately gives rise to the infinite loop.
