Explicit Allocator Scenario:  Allocation Fails under First-Fit but not Best-Fit
===============================================================================

Note: I will use positive numbers to denote free regions and negative numbers
to denote allocated regions. For instance, if I write:

-10, 30, -5, 50 

This would mean I have 4 blocks: the first block is 10 kb and allocated,
the second block is 30kb and free, the third block is -5 and allocated, and
the fourth and final block is 50kb and free. In addition, all units will be in
KB.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total heap size: 100 (kb)

Steps: 
1) Allocate block 1 of 25               
2) Allocate block 2 of 30
3) Allocate block 3 of 25
4) Free block 2
5) Allocate block 4 of 15
6) Allocate block 5 of 22 

From steps 1-4 inclusive, we have that the first-fit and best-fit behave 
exactly the same (because until step 4, we only have a single free block
so both policies will allocate blocks in consecutive fashion and with
regards to step 4, we know that freeing acts independent of policy). So up 
through step 4, we have the following configuration:

-25, 30, -25, 20

Now with steps 5 and 6, we have diverging behavior based on the policy. Let's
start with first-fit. Step 5 wants us to allocate a block of 15 and seeing
that block 2 (30 kb block) is the first valid block, we go ahead and allocate
and split block 2, so now we have :

-25, -15, 15, -25, 20

With step 6, we try to allocate a block of 22 but it is obvious to see that
we lack adequate free space so we have allocation failure under the first-fit
policy. 

Now, let's backtrack and see what would happen if we tried a best-fit
policy. So recall, at the start of step 5, we had this configuration:

-25, 30, -25, 20

Now, under best-fit policy, when we do step 5 and allocate block 4 of 15,
we will have:

-25, 30, -25, -15, 5

Now, when we try to allocate block 5 of size 22, we see that unlike the case
with first-fit policy, we actually have space. So after step 6, we have:

-25, -22, 8, -25, -15, 5.

Thus, we have contrived a situation where first-fit policy will result in
allocation failure while best-fit does not.
