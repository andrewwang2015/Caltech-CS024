Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?

We could first call mprotect and set the permission to be PROT_NONE. Now, when
the page is accessed, a segfault will be generated. We can then detect this
segfault which would indicate that the page was accessed. After detecting this
segfault we can then give the page the proper permission/access level (for
purposes of detecting dirty pages, we typically set it to have PROT_READ). 

b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?

We call mprotect to set the permission of the page to be PROT_READ. Then,
we know that any call to write on this page will elicit a segfault. We can
detect this segfault which means that something wants to write to this page
and so therefore the page becomes dirty. We can then set the permission to be
PROT_WRITE, so future writes will be fine.

f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:

Total page loads:  52110


g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  FIFO

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  

Total page loads:  47944


If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  CLOCK/LRU

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  

Total page loads:  6834
