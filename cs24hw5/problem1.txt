a.

3 GHz = 3 * 10^9 cycles/second 
Let's call our miss rate x. Per data value, the expected latency is 
100x + (1-x) = (99x + 1) cycles.

Now, we have that per second, we have 750M instructions which means 750M
data values to retrieve. 

Multiplying each data value by the expected latency for that data value
and equating that with the number of cycles the processor can run per
second, we get:

750,000,000 instructions/second * (99x + 1) cycles/instruction = 
                                                    3 * 10^9 cycles/second

Solving for x, our miss rate, we get:

(99x + 1) cycles/instruction = 4 cycles/instruction

99x = 3

x = miss rate = 1/33

b. 

Doubling the performance would mean we want 1,500,000,000 instructions
per second. 

Doing the same calculation as above:

1,500,000,000 instructions/second * (99x + 1) cycles/instruction = 
                                                    3 * 10^9 cycles/second

Solving for x, our miss rate, we get:

(99x + 1) cycles/instruction = 2 cycles/instruction

99x = 1

x = miss rate = 1/99

We would have to reduce the miss rate by one-third.
